# lxqt-admin

## Overview

This repository is providing two GUI tools to adjust settings of the operating system LXQt is running on.

Both are using [polkit](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/polkit/) to handle permissions.   
In contrast to the specific backends described below earlier versions of lxqt-admin were relying on [system-tools-backends](http://system-tools-backends.freedesktop.org) and their wrapper [liboobs](https://github.com/GNOME/liboobs). These were replaced as both go unmaintained for years and were hence dropped from many distributions heavily restricting the usage of lxqt-admin. As long as they can be built it should still be possible to compile lxqt-admin release â‰¤ 0.10 against them in order to make use of it on platforms lacking systemd like BSD.   

### Time and date configuration

Adjusts time and date. Binary is `lxqt-admin-time`.

It is using `systemd-timedated` as backend which is accessed by its D-Bus interface. Among other this means the option
to sync the system time by NTP is relying on `systemd-timesyncd` as backend.

### User and Group Settings

Management of users and groups. Binary is `lxqt-admin-user`.

The backend is a script `lxqt-admin-user-helper`. By default it is in turn using the shadow tools to do the actual work.
The script can be modified to use different tools, though.

## Installing

### Compiling sources

Runtime dependencies are polkit and [liblxqt](https://github.com/lxde/liblxqt). A polkit agent should be available with [lxqt-policykit](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt-policykit/) representing the first choice in LXQt.   
Additional build dependencies are CMake and optionally Git to pull latest VCS checkouts. The localization files were outsourced to repository [lxqt-l10n](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt-l10n) so the corresponding dependencies are needed, too. Please refer to this repository's `README.md` for further information.

Code configuration is handled by CMake. CMake variable `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` will normally have to be set to `/usr`.   

To build run `make`, to install `make install` which accepts variable `DESTDIR` as usual.   

### Binary packages

#### Arch Linux

[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) packages `lxqt-admin` and `lxqt-admin-git` are providing the current stable release and the
actual master checkout at compile time as usual.   
Note that package `lxqt-admin` had to be kept in the AUR due to lack of the dependency liboobs as depicted [above](#overview).
So it will be transferred to community as of release 0.11.

#### Debian

Package `lxqt-admin` is available in the official repositories as of Debian stretch.

#### Fedora

Fedora doesn't provide lxqt-admin so far due to lack of the dependency liboobs as depicted [above](#overview). This will hopefully change
once release LXQt release 0.11 makes it into the Fedora repositories.

#### openSUSE

openSUSE does not ship with lxqt-admin in it's standard repositories since the functionality is covered by openSUSE's [YaST](http://yast.github.io/).
However it is still possible to install it on openSUSE. The package and its dependencies, like the [above](#overview) mentioned, outdated liboobs are available through the [X11:LXQt](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/X11:LXQt) repository.

## Usage

Much like similar tools provided by [lxqt-config](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt-config) the tools of lxqt-admin can be launched from the [Configuration Center](https://github.com/lxde/lxqt-config#configuration-center) as well as from the panel's main menu - Preferences - LXQt settings.   

The actual usage should be self-explanatory. To apply settings the GUI of the polkit authentication agent that's in use is
launched to acquire the root password.
